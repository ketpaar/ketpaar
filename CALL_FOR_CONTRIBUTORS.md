# Join Us in Building Ketpaar (கேட்பார்) - A Platform for Dignified Giving

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Ketpaar** is an open-source initiative to transform charitable giving by creating a transparent, dignified platform that connects donors with alms seekers through verified food delivery services. We ensure charitable donations reach their intended purpose - providing food and essentials rather than cash that could be misused.

**Our Mission:** Enable compassionate giving while maintaining dignity for all parties involved.

---

## 🤝 Why This Matters

Every day, people encounter those seeking alms and face a difficult choice - help with cash that may be misused, or walk away. Ketpaar solves this by:

- ✅ Ensuring donations become meals and essentials, not cash
- ✅ Providing delivery confirmation with photo proof
- ✅ Maintaining dignity for both donors and seekers
- ✅ Leveraging existing delivery infrastructure
- ✅ Creating community solidarity through pledge pools and crowdfunding

**Impact Potential:** Millions of charitable interactions yearly could become transparent, accountable acts of kindness.
